My name is Yishi Deng.

This is the updated version of the RubeGoldberg project for Udacity.
I have fixed the Object Menu and throwable object issues that occued in the previous version. 
I am still having issue to make the collectible stars disapeared when hit by the ball.
The code is in the "Goal.cs" file and the "Collectible.cs" file.

Thank you so much for your time.
