It took me almost 6 weeks to finish this challege because I was making my thesis VR project at the same with with this project.

I found the ObjectManager is the most challenging part of this prject. It took me a little over two weeks to finally made it work. I have watched the tutorials on Udacity, on YouTube to understand the new SteamVR. I found the student Hub is particularly helpful. I found a lot of answers to my questions there. The project is not perfect but the end result is sooooo rewarding to me.

Now I have to catch up with the next project since I am so behind the schedule.

I am using Oculus Rift.
